For frontend:
Make a note of the time at initial load.
Calculate the amount of time left until midnight.
Set a Timeout to reload the document after that time elapses.


I use the following code:

function resetAtMidnight() {
    var now = new Date();
    var night = new Date(
        now.getFullYear(),
        now.getMonth(),
        now.getDate() + 1, // the next day, ...
        0, 0, 0 // ...at 00:00:00 hours
    );
    var msToMidnight = night.getTime() - now.getTime();

    setTimeout(function() {
        reset();              //      <-- This is the function being called at midnight.
        resetAtMidnight();    //      Then, reset again next midnight.
    }, msToMidnight);
}
I think there are legitimate use-cases for running a function at midnight. For example, in my case, I have a number of daily statistics displayed on a website. These statistics need to be reset if the website happens to be open at midnight.


The Location.reload() method reloads the current URL, like the Refresh button.

Reload the current document:

location.reload();
